Below is a **clean, high-signal inquiry** you can send to the dev team. It is framed to elicit precise answers, surface root causes, and avoid hand-waving. After that, I give you a **direct interpretation** of what likely needs to be fixed, so you may not even need to ask.

---

## A. Rephrased inquiry (intelligent, precise, non-accusatory)

> **Context:**
> Following the Phase 0 / Phase 1 backend changes (explicit universe, removal of SIMULATION_MODE, stricter config validation, and improved observability semantics), I want to confirm that the UI and agent lifecycle correctly reflect the new execution model—particularly during **market-closed periods** and **paper/sim operation**.
>
> **Questions:**
>
> 1. **Agent lifecycle vs. market state**
>    Are agents (data, signal, risk, execution, monitor, alert) designed to be *inactive* when the market is closed, or should they still transition into a defined non-trading state (e.g., `IDLE`, `BLOCKED`, `WAITING_FOR_MARKET`) rather than remaining indefinitely in `Loading`?
>
> 2. **Observability decoupling**
>    Is observability currently coupled to active market data / trading loops?
>    If so, is this intentional, or should observability agents still emit:
>
>    * heartbeats
>    * last-evaluated timestamps
>    * stale-data indicators
>      even when the market is closed or execution is disabled?
>
> 3. **Universe and header state correctness**
>    The header still displays `SIM ON` and a red `MARKET` indicator without an explicit `OPEN / CLOSED` distinction.
>
>    * Is the UI still deriving state from legacy flags rather than the authoritative runtime universe?
>    * Should the header now be driven exclusively by server-reported universe + broker clock status?
>
> 4. **Data availability vs. UI “loading” states**
>    Several panels (symbol names, analytics & reporting, position concentration, trade performance, historical trades, watchlist signals) remain in a permanent `Loading` or empty state when the market is closed.
>
>    * Is this because upstream agents are not running, or because the UI is waiting on signals that are only emitted during active trading?
>
> 5. **Analytics population expectations**
>    Should historical analytics, trade logs, and position concentration charts be expected to populate from persisted data regardless of market state, or are they currently tied to a live session loop?
>
> 6. **Alert retention and evaluation window**
>    Risk & observability alerts appear truncated and not time-normalized.
>    Would it be more correct to:
>
>    * evaluate alerts over a rolling 24-hour window (e.g., 00:00–23:59), and
>    * archive prior periods for auditability and trend analysis?
>
> 7. **Meta-observability**
>    Is there value in introducing a lightweight “observability review” agent that periodically evaluates:
>
>    * agent uptime
>    * stale states
>    * missed evaluations
>    * overall system health
>      and emits a single synthesized health score or summary?
>
> **Goal:**
> Ensure that during market-closed periods, paper trading, and simulation, the system presents **truthful, interpretable, and non-misleading state**, rather than appearing stalled or broken.

## B. What this really implies (you may not need to ask)

Based on the screenshots **and** the recent fixes, here is what is almost certainly happening:

### 1. Agents are incorrectly tied to “market open”

Agents are likely:

* instantiated lazily
* or only start their loops when `market_open == True`

**Fix needed:**
Agents must enter a **defined non-trading state** when the market is closed, not remain in `Loading`.

Expected states:

* `INITIALIZED`
* `IDLE (market closed)`
* `BLOCKED (breaker)`
* `RUNNING`

---

### 2. Observability is still downstream of execution

Right now, observability appears to depend on:

* trades
* signals
* execution ticks

That is backwards.

**Fix needed:**
Observability must be **upstream and always-on**:

* heartbeats independent of market
* “no data because market closed” is a *state*, not silence

---

### 3. UI is still partially wired to legacy flags

The presence of:

* `SIM ON`
* red `MARKET` with no semantic label

means the UI is still reading:

* old config fields
* or inferred booleans

**Fix needed:**
UI header must be driven by a single `/system/status` endpoint:

```json
{
  "universe": "PAPER",
  "market_state": "CLOSED",
  "execution_state": "BLOCKED",
  "auto_trade": "ENABLED"
}
```

No local inference.

---

### 4. “Loading” states are masking “intentionally idle”

Many panels should show:

* “No data yet”
* “Market closed”
* “No completed trades”

Instead they show `Loading`, which implies failure.

**Fix needed:**
Replace indefinite loading with **terminal empty states** once data is known to be absent.

---

### 5. Analytics are incorrectly session-bound

Historical analytics should render from persisted storage even if:

* no agents are running
* market is closed

If they don’t, the analytics loader is probably tied to a live loop.

**Fix needed:**
Decouple analytics read paths from runtime agent execution.

---

### 6. Alerts need time semantics

Your intuition is correct: alerts need:

* a defined evaluation window
* archival semantics
* severity aggregation

This is not cosmetic — it’s auditability.

---

### 7. Meta-observability agent is a good idea (later)

Not required now, but your instinct is right:

* once LIVE, humans will not inspect raw logs
* a summarizing agent becomes valuable

This is **Phase 2 / pre-scale**, not immediate.

---

## Bottom line

You are not asking for “new features.”
You are uncovering **state-model mismatches** between:

* backend correctness (now strong)
* agent lifecycle assumptions (lagging)
* UI truthfulness (lagging)

If you want, next I can:

* reduce this to a **fix checklist**
* or help you write a **one-page internal design note** explaining the correct mental model so the UI and agents converge cleanly
