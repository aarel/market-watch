❯ market's closed but autotrade and paper trade is on. am I supposed to just leave this and see whats up after? its friday too which kind of sucks since I'll have the whole weekend
  without being able to make edits and test them or progress paper trading to get a lot of data that can be used (Momentum looks at past 20 days right?) also, are there different
  strategies or whatever, not only top gainers but maybe penny stocks like on robinhood app?

● Great questions! Let me address each:

  1. Market Closed - What to Do Now

  Yes, you can leave it running. The system will:
  - Poll every few seconds
  - See market is closed
  - Wait idle until Monday 9:30 AM EST
  - Automatically start trading when market opens

  Or you can stop it and restart Monday morning - either way works.

  The issue is you mentioned agents showing "Loading" - they should show "IDLE (market closed)" instead. This is one of the P1 items.

  2. Weekend Development - Use SIMULATION Mode!

  You're right, Friday evening is unfortunate timing. But you can develop and test over the weekend using SIMULATION mode:

  # In .env, change:
  TRADING_MODE=simulation
  AUTO_TRADE=true

  # Restart
  ./start_app.sh

  SIMULATION mode:
  - ✅ Uses FakeBroker (synthetic prices, no real API)
  - ✅ Works 24/7, doesn't care about market hours
  - ✅ Lets you test code changes immediately
  - ✅ No API rate limits
  - ✅ Perfect for development

  Use SIMULATION this weekend to:
  - Test P1 improvements
  - Debug agent lifecycle
  - Test shutdown semantics
  - Verify observability panels
  - Run hundreds of test trades

  Then switch back to PAPER Monday morning for real data.

  3. Momentum Strategy - Let Me Check

  Let me look at what the momentum strategy actually does:

● Searched for 3 patterns, read 3 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● Perfect! Let me answer all your questions:

  ---
  3. Momentum Strategy - Yes, 20 Days

  Current momentum strategy (strategies/momentum.py):
  - ✅ Lookback: 20 days (config.LOOKBACK_DAYS)
  - Calculates rate of change over 20-day period
  - Buy signal: Momentum > 2% over 20 days
  - Sell signal: Momentum drops below -1% OR stop-loss at -5%

  Example:
  - Stock was $100 20 days ago, now $105 → 5% momentum → BUY
  - Stock drops to $102 (2% momentum) → HOLD
  - Stock drops to $99 (-1% momentum) → SELL

  4. Available Strategies - You Have 4!

  Your system has 4 built-in strategies:

  1. Momentum (current default)

  STRATEGY=momentum
  - Buys stocks with strong upward price momentum (2%+ over 20 days)
  - Sells on momentum reversal or 5% stop-loss
  - Best for: Trending markets, riding winners

  2. Breakout

  STRATEGY=breakout
  - Buys when price breaks above 20-day high
  - Sells when price breaks below 20-day low
  - Best for: Volatile markets, catching big moves

  3. Mean Reversion

  STRATEGY=mean_reversion
  - Buys oversold stocks (expecting bounce back)
  - Sells overbought stocks
  - Best for: Range-bound markets, quick profits

  4. RSI (Relative Strength Index)

  STRATEGY=rsi
  - Uses RSI indicator to find oversold/overbought stocks
  - Buy when RSI < 30 (oversold), sell when RSI > 70 (overbought)
  - Best for: Technical traders, oscillating markets

  To change strategy:
  # In .env file
  STRATEGY=breakout  # or momentum, mean_reversion, rsi

  ---
  5. Penny Stocks & Watchlist Options

  Penny Stocks Configuration

  Current filter:
  TOP_GAINERS_MIN_PRICE = 5.0  # Only stocks above $5

  To include penny stocks:
  # In .env
  TOP_GAINERS_MIN_PRICE=1.0   # Stocks above $1
  # or
  TOP_GAINERS_MIN_PRICE=0.50  # Stocks above $0.50

  ⚠️ Warning about penny stocks:
  - Higher volatility (bigger gains AND losses)
  - Lower liquidity (harder to sell)
  - Circuit breaker will trigger more often
  - 5% stop-loss might hit instantly

  Watchlist Modes

  You have 2 watchlist modes:

  Mode 1: Top Gainers (current default)

  WATCHLIST_MODE=top_gainers
  - Automatically finds stocks with highest % gain today
  - Refreshes dynamically
  - Good for momentum trading
  - Filters by MIN_PRICE

  Mode 2: Static Watchlist

  WATCHLIST_MODE=static
  WATCHLIST=["AAPL", "NVDA", "TSLA", "AMD", "PLTR"]  # Set in config.py
  - Trades only specific stocks you choose
  - Good for: Blue chips, stocks you trust, specific sectors
  - Can include penny stocks manually

  Weekend Action Plan

  Since it's Friday evening, here's what I recommend:

  Option A: Leave PAPER running (passive)

  # Just leave it running
  # It will auto-start trading Monday 9:30 AM EST
  # Check back Monday to see results

  Option B: Switch to SIMULATION for weekend development (active)

  # Stop current server (Ctrl+C)

  # Edit .env
  TRADING_MODE=simulation
  AUTO_TRADE=true
  STRATEGY=momentum  # or try breakout, mean_reversion, rsi

  # Restart
  ./start_app.sh

  Weekend experiments with SIMULATION:
  1. Test different strategies:
    - Try each strategy (momentum, breakout, mean_reversion, rsi)
    - See which generates more signals
    - Compare win rates
  2. Test penny stocks:
    - Set TOP_GAINERS_MIN_PRICE=1.0
    - See if trades execute faster (more volatility)
  3. Work on P1 improvements:
    - Fix agent "Loading" states
    - Add shutdown semantics
    - Improve observability
  4. Generate test data:
    - SIMULATION generates synthetic trades
    - You'll have analytics data to verify dashboards work

  Monday morning: Switch back to PAPER to see real market behavior.

  Example .env for Weekend Testing

  # Simulation mode - works 24/7
  TRADING_MODE=simulation
  AUTO_TRADE=true

  # Try different strategy
  STRATEGY=breakout  # or momentum, mean_reversion, rsi

  # Test penny stocks
  TOP_GAINERS_MIN_PRICE=1.0

  # Watchlist mode
  WATCHLIST_MODE=top_gainers

  Bottom Line

  For this weekend:
  - ✅ Use SIMULATION mode to develop and test
  - ✅ Try different strategies (breakout might be fun!)
  - ✅ Test penny stocks safely
  - ✅ Work on P1 improvements

  Monday morning:
  - ✅ Switch back to PAPER mode
  - ✅ Let it trade with real Alpaca paper money
  - ✅ Collect real market data

  The 20-day lookback won't be a problem - Alpaca provides historical data, so the momentum calculation will work on day 1 of paper trading.

  Want me to help you set up SIMULATION mode for weekend testing, or do you prefer to leave PAPER running idle?
