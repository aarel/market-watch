I’m going to answer this at the same DRA reasoning level, just applied to UI as a safety-critical system, not dumbed down. I’ll be explicit where the UI currently violates the post-Phase-1 contract you just enforced in code.

I’ll structure this as:

Environment truth vs UI claims

Critical UI mismatches (must fix before paper/live)

Observability gaps (epistemic risk)

Configuration surface problems

Concrete UI changes (actionable)

Verdict: paper-trading readiness from a UI standpoint

1. Environment truth vs what the UI currently communicates

From the screenshots, the UI is presenting multiple environment signals simultaneously:

Top-right badges:

MARKET (red)

SIM ON (green)

PAPER

AUTO-TRADE ON

This is not compatible with the post-Phase-1 architecture.

Ground truth after Phase 1 (from your backend):

There is exactly one universe per process: LIVE, PAPER, or SIMULATION

SIMULATION_MODE no longer exists

“SIM” is a universe, not a toggle

Market open/closed is orthogonal to universe

Auto-trade is a validated runtime config, not a mode

UI implication:

Right now, the UI is encoding a pre-Phase-1 mental model:

“SIM is a toggle that can coexist with PAPER”

That is architecturally false now.

2. Critical UI mismatches (production-blocking if left unchanged)
2.1 SIM ON badge is now invalid

Problem

UI shows SIM ON as if simulation is an overlay

Backend no longer supports this concept

Risk

Operator believes they are “safe” because SIM is on

But process is actually running PAPER or LIVE

This is classic epistemic harm

Required change

Remove SIM ON entirely

Replace with a single Universe badge:

UNIVERSE: PAPER

UNIVERSE: SIMULATION

UNIVERSE: LIVE

Color-coded, immutable, derived from server state.

2.2 MARKET badge is ambiguous

You show MARKET in red, but:

Is that “market open”?

Or “market context loaded”?

Or “market data stale”?

There is no legend.

Given your code changes, the UI must distinguish:

Signal	Meaning
Market Open	Broker clock says tradable
Market Closed	Broker clock closed
Data Freshness	Quotes within threshold
Execution Enabled	Auto-trade + breaker inactive

Right now these are collapsed into a single badge.

Required change
Split into:

MARKET: OPEN / CLOSED

DATA: FRESH / STALE (Xs)

EXECUTION: ENABLED / BLOCKED

2.3 AUTO-TRADE ON lacks guardrails

The UI shows AUTO-TRADE ON as a green badge, but:

There is no visible confirmation that:

circuit breaker is inactive

daily loss limit not breached

universe ≠ SIMULATION (if PAPER/LIVE)

Risk

Auto-trade appears enabled even when execution is blocked

Operator misreads system readiness

Required change
Auto-trade badge should be tri-state:

AUTO-TRADE: ENABLED

AUTO-TRADE: BLOCKED (Circuit Breaker)

AUTO-TRADE: DISABLED (Config)

3. Observability: good foundation, but still lying by omission

Your Observability panel is directionally excellent, but incomplete.

What it does well

Explicit OK / WARN / FAIL counts

Human-readable findings

“Run Eval” affordance

Separation from risk limits

This is better than most retail trading UIs.

Critical missing pieces
3.1 No universe context in observability

Observability must be universe-scoped.

Right now:

“All expectations within bounds.”

But for which universe?

Required

Header: Observability (PAPER)

Eval result must include universe id / session id

3.2 No freshness / heartbeat indicators

Your AGENTS panel shows “Loading” for all agents.

Ambiguity

Is the agent down?

Starting?

Blocked by market closed?

Crashed?

Required
For each agent:

Last tick timestamp

State: RUNNING / IDLE / BLOCKED / ERROR

Reason (market closed, breaker active, waiting for data)

3.3 Alerts panel lacks severity semantics

Alerts are shown as WARNs, but:

Circuit breaker activation is not just a warning

It is a hard execution state change

Required

Severity taxonomy:

INFO (telemetry)

WARN (approaching limits)

FAIL (execution halted)

Visual differentiation (not just color)

4. Configuration surface problems
4.1 Configuration implies hot-reload of unsafe fields

The configuration UI allows editing:

Strategy

Risk limits

Thresholds

Max positions

But the backend now has strict rules:

Some config changes require rebuild

Some require restart

Some are runtime-safe

The UI does not communicate this.

Risk
Operator believes changes apply immediately when they do not (or vice versa).

Required
Each config field must declare:

Runtime-safe

Requires rebuild

Requires restart

And the UI must enforce or warn accordingly.

4.2 Watchlist ambiguity

You allow both:

Top % Gainers mode

Manual watchlist entry

But the UI does not make precedence explicit.

Required
Explicit rule displayed:

“Watchlist source: TOP GAINERS (overrides manual list)”

5. Positions panel: correctness but missing provenance

The Positions panel is mostly correct, but:

5.1 Missing symbol name

You have “AMZN — Loading name…”

This is minor UX, but in trading systems:

Missing metadata reduces trust

Looks like data pipeline instability

Fixing this matters psychologically.

5.2 No universe label per position

Every position should show:

Universe

Broker

Opened at (timestamp)

Especially when you move to LIVE.

6. Concrete UI changes (priority-ordered)
P0 – Must fix before paper trading UI freeze

Remove SIM ON badge

Add single immutable UNIVERSE badge

Split MARKET into:

Market Open/Closed

Data Freshness

Auto-trade tri-state badge

Observability header shows universe + session id

P1 – Before micro-capital LIVE

Agent heartbeat + last tick

Config fields labeled by reload semantics

Alert severity taxonomy

Execution-blocked explanation panel (“Why am I not trading?”)

P2 – Trust & clarity improvements

Position provenance

Watchlist precedence clarity

Explicit “Paper vs Live consequences” banner when LIVE

Final verdict (UI perspective)

Is the UI usable for paper trading right now?
Yes — with one caveat:

You must remove or correct the SIM ON mental model, or you risk operator misinterpretation even in paper mode.

Is the UI ready for micro-capital LIVE as-is?
No — not because of execution, but because of epistemic risk.

The backend is now safer than the UI is communicating.
